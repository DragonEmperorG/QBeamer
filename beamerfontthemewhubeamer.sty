% A font theme dictates which fonts or font attributes are used in a presentation. Similar to
% colors, the font of all text elements used in a presentation can be specified independently.

% 18.1 Font Themes
% This font theme does not really change any fonts. Rather, it suppresses certain internal replacements
% performed by beamer. If you use “professional fonts” (fonts that you buy and that come with a
% complete set of every symbol in all modes), you do not want beamer to meddle with the fonts you
% use. beamer normally replaces certain character glyphs in mathematical text by more appropriate
% versions. For example, beamer will normally replace glyphs such that the italic characters from the
% main font are used for variables in mathematical text. If your professional font package takes care of this
% already, beamer’s meddling should be switched off. Note that beamer’s substitution is automatically
% turned off if one of the following packages is loaded: arevmath, hvmath, kpfonts, lmodern, lucidabr,
% lucimatx, mathastext, mathpmnt, mathpple, mathtime, mtpro, and mtpro2. It is also turned off when
% unicode-math is loaded for the use of Unicode math fonts. If your favorite professional font package is
% not among these, use the professionalfonts theme (and open an issue in our github bug tracker, so
% that the package can be added).

% \usefonttheme[⟨options⟩]{structurebold}
% This font theme will cause titles and text in the headlines, footlines, and sidebars to be typeset in a
% bold font.
% The following ⟨options⟩ may be given:
%   • onlysmall will cause only “small” text to be typeset in bold. More precisely, only the text in the
%     headline, footline, and sidebars is changed to be typeset in bold. Large titles are not affected.
%   • onlylarge will cause only “large” text to be typeset in bold. These are the main title, frame titles,
%     and section entries in the table of contents.
